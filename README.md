## Testing the project

For this test I have created the project using Inertia JS & Tailwind. I was able to use components for forms and the 
general front end structure I was using in a previous project.

I have provided some unit tests for the back end but not the front end - this could be added but weould need more time

```
composer install
php artisan migrate:seed
yarn // or npm install
yarn production
```
